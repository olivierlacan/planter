A simple planner for plants. Get it? Plan[t]er.

## Purpose

This repository contains the final Rails application created 
in my Pluralsight course [Ruby on Rails: The Big Picture][rorbp]. 
A paid subscription is required to watch this course. 

## Versioning

The current `main` branch contains the code for the latest version
of the course released in May 2024 and which targets Ruby 3.3 and 
Rails 7.1. This code will remain available in the [ruby-3-3-rails-7-1][v2] 
branch in the future.

For the 2020 version of the course which targets Ruby 2.7 and 
Rails 6.1 you can check out the [ruby-2-7-rails-6-1][v1] branch.
